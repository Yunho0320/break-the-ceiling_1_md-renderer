## break-the-ceiling
Break-the-Ceiling is a personal coding challenge consisting of multiple projects across 
diverse technical domains—such as systems programming, concurrency, networking, finance, full-stack development etc. 
The goal is to push past current skill limits, systematically deepen mastery in Java and related technologies.
Each project is designed to break a “ceiling” in understanding or ability, forming a structured path toward 
becoming a seasoned developer.

## md-renderer
This is a full-stack learning platform built with **Java** and **Vue** that parses `.md` (Markdown) files 
into structured content blocks such as headings, code, tips, and outputs — 
and displays them nicely on the web.
